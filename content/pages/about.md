As a mechanical engineer, I initiated myself in the path of technology and automation as a project manager at an engineering solutions enterprise while also working at a seasonal job in music events. Which in due course lead me to a position as Technical Leader at the FinTech responsible for the most emblematic mass events in MÃ©xico in 2019 and 2020.

Subsequently, I dived into learning Computer Science, forming myself in software development, proficiency in English in professional environments, and soft skills in Platzi, the best Spanish-speaking e-learning platform. Who, recently, selected me to form part of the top 1% student's program, called Platzi Master, taking my practical learning to peak level.

I'm currently interested in an opportunity as a Frontend Web Developer, specialized in JavaScript, that allows me to grow professionally, help others and build a community around learning.
