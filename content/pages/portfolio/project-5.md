This challenge was part of a technical test for **Platzi Master** where I had to make a graph from two parameters that you receive by inputs from the user as follows: 

1.  Enter X-axis value.

2.  Enter Y-axis value.

3.  Show point in a visual Cartesian plane where the location given by the Axes. 

Additionally, the user can create a static bar chart of 5 series in X: 

1.  Enter 5 sets of values for \[x,y] 

2.  Show bar chart with the values that were provided in the previous step. 

3.  The user will be able to delete everything and start over with other values as many times as possible Want. Values and graphs should not be stored.

I used a JavaScript library, called [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), to be able to create a chart from JavaScript using a canva element in HTML.
