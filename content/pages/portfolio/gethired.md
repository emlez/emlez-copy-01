**Platzi Master** is an online education program aimed at technical deepening and professional growth in software development.

During 5 months of immersed training in five different parallel scenarios of comprehensive training that include English, professional growth, product development with software, technical leadership and tech community.

Additionally, receiving feedback on my process through interviews and technical tests led by Platzi Master team of experts.

We‚Äôve developed a tool that receives data from real-life job offers and shows it as a bell curve chart with the salaries currently offered for their profile. As well as allowing them to compare this chart against a second professional profile.
All of this while being able to show and filter the job offers that apply to the user.

## What we did

- Created a community design system and deployed it as a package available at NPM
- Developed an interface to calculate and compare salary from a tech stack
- Presented the salary range available from real-life job offers as a dynamic bell curve chart
- Created APIs to return requested salary ranges and convert its currency to almost any in the world
- Displayed   a   list   of   job   offers   that   filters   those   relevant   to   a   specific professional profile

## What we wanted to achieve

Create a tool to help tech professionals know what salary range is available for their profile in the current market.
And compare it against another skill set, so they can make a well-informed decision on how to grow professionally.

## How it works

Our component receives data from job offers in our platform and shows a bell curve chart with the  salaries  currently  offered  for  the professional role and skill set the user entered.
Allows them to compare this chart with a second profile.
Being able to show and filter the job offers that might apply to them.

## What we learned

- Work asynchronously as a remote team
- Translate a product idea into a design, and only then into code
- Create a development environment following best practices
- Learn and apply a new tech stack to deliver a better product
- Better communicate, give and receive feedback, and mentor others
