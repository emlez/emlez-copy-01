Along the [Say My Brand 2.0 challenge](https://platzi.com/p/emlez/curso/2528-saymybrand/diploma/detalle/), I worked on my presence around the web; from social media accounts to my professional objective.

As a part of the challenge, I worked on my website and developed it with a blog functionality using Jamstack.

> "The expert in anything was once a beginner."

I always felt like this kind of work could take me a lot of time to develop, but thanks to a Low-Code tool such as Stackbit, I was able to make it happen and continiuosly grow as my web development skills improve too.

This particular site is built with React,js and Next.js, using Netlify for its deployment and GitHub for its version control.
