          I've been following the Web Development School learning path at
          Platzi, and from its past a hundred courses (I've taken almost 80) I
          have been able to learn the fundamentals of HTML & CSS.

          I don't think software development would work without these version
          control tools, and that's why I've been sharpening my Git skills even
          though an IDE makes it easier than ever to get started.

          JS is not my first ever programming language, but it's definitely the
          one I've spent the most time with.


          > Try, fail, learn, refine.


          That's probably the best way to describe my journey, and the greatest
          thing is that I can always keep on learning because of how inmense
          this technology is.

          I've been given the opportunity to work with graphic designers, data
          analysts, backend and frontend developers for a major web project, and
          I don't think I can make it without an agile methodology like SCRUM.
