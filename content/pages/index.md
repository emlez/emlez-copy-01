          I've followed the Web Development School learning path at Platzi and
          from its over a hundred courses (I've taken almost 80 of them!) I have
          been able to learn the fundamentals and some secrets and peculiarities
          of HTML5 & CSS3.


          From CSS Flexbox, Grid and Specificity to Semantic HTML and its
          accessibility and SEO-positioning features.


          Everyone's path is different, I'm just really glad I started from the
          beginning.

          JS is not my first ever programming language, but it's definitely the
          one I've spent the most time with.


          > Try, fail, learn, refine.


          That's probably the best way to describe my journey, and the greatest
          thing is that I can always keep on learning because of how inmense
          this technology is.

          I don't think software development would work, as good as it does,
          without these version control tools, and that's why I've been
          sharpening my Git skills even though an IDE makes it easier than ever
          to get started.

          I've worked with Graphic Designers, Data Analysts, Back End and Front
          End developers for a major web project, and I don't think I can make
          it without an agile methodology like SCRUM.


          With it, we've managed to interact and make amazing progress on our
          plans, even when we are working from 3 different time zones.
