          I'm a Software Engineer at TryNow, using my Front End development knowledge to bring Try Before You Buy software to 40+ Shopify e-commerce stores.


          Always interested in opportunities that allow me to grow personally and professionally, help others, and build a community around learning.

                That's probably the best way to describe my journey, and the greatest
                thing is that I can always keep on learning because of how immense
                JavaScript is.


                I'm currently working on multiple projects to improve my skills and
                try new things, like Astro.js and Tailwind CSS.

                I've been using TypeScript for over a year now, and it has enabled me to
                write better code, and to catch bugs before they even happen.


                I've been able to use it in a wide variety of projects, from React
                components to Core Team projects at TryNow.


                I'm currently working on a TypeScript project to help me improve my
                algorithmic and data structure skills.

                Creating components and building apps with React is a joy, and I'm
                always looking for new ways to improve my skills and learn new
                things.


                I've been working with React for over three years now, and I've been able
                to work with a wide variety of clients, projects and developers.


                I'm currently working with Next.js on the Core Team at TryNow.

                I code in Liquid daily, Shopify's templating language, to
                create custom features and functionalities for clients.


                I've developed features from scratch, and I've also worked with existing
                themes to customize them to the client's needs while bringing the
                Try Before You Buy experience to 40+ stores.


                I'm currently working on prototyping experiments to improve
                the Try Before You Buy experience.
