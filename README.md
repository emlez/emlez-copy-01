# emlez.dev üíú

Along the [Say My Brand 2.0 challenge](https://postimg.cc/ThcSmFds), I worked on my presence around the web; from social media accounts to my professional objective.

As a part of the challenge, I worked on my website and developed it with a blog functionality using **Jamstack**.

    "The expert in anything was once a beginner."

I always felt like this kind of work could take me a lot of time to develop, but thanks to a Low-Code tool such as Stackbit, I was able to make it happen and continiuosly grow as my web development skills improve too.

This particular site is built with: 
- **React.js** and **Next.js** to develop a development interface that can accept **Markdown** files and convert them into **HTML** and **CSS** using only **JavaScript**.
- **Netlify** for its deployment to the web. 
- **GitHub** for its version control.

## Develop Locally

1. [Create a site](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/exto-nextjs&utm_source=theme-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stackbit_themes) from this theme using Stackbit.

1. Once finished, you will be redirected to Stackbit Studio where you will be
   able to edit the content using the free on-page editing experience, and
   publish new versions of your site.

1. To further develop your site, clone the generated repository.

1. Install dependencies

       npm install
       
1. Start the Next.js local development server:

        npm run develop

1. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in the browser to see
   your site. You can now edit the site contents, and the browser will
   live-update your changes. üéâ


## Building for production üèó

To build a static site for production, or test locally how it works, run the
following command:

    npm run build

The exported site will be written to `out` folder. The contents of this folder 
can be deployed by serverless deployment platform such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
You can start a local server serving the static files from the `out` folder, for
example by installing and running `http-server`:

    npm install http-server -g
    http-server out
